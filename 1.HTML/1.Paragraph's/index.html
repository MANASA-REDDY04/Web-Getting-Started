    <!-- PARAGRAPH
    Browsers built-in style sheets, automatically create some space above and below the content of a paragraph (called margin), but you can override it using CSS.
    -> works with simply an open tag also.. <p> hello there 
        but not advisable , better practice to use both open and closing tag
    -->

    <p>hello this is my first paragraph. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit. Ad, nam minus ut
        recusandae numquam nesciunt rem harum. Vitae et quibusdam fuga impedit magni perspiciatis, corporis assumenda
        suscipit, blanditiis accusamus aut.</p>
    <p>hello this is my second paragraph. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur, adipisicing elit. Deleniti tempore,
        excepturi dolore, dignissimos unde eveniet itaque incidunt eligendi, facilis doloribus esse aspernatur aperiam
        saepe consectetur?</p>

    <!-- LINE BREAK (Empty tag :- they don't require closing tag)-->
    <p>hello everyone <br> how are you doing?</p>

    <!-- HORIZONTAL LINES -->
    <p>Lorem ipsum dolor, sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit.
        <hr> Ea nam qui odit architecto sequi adipisci atque cupiditate pariatur illum,
        <hr> aut in iure recusandae error inventore quos dolorem. Repellendus, fuga minus?
    </p>

    <!-- MANAGING WHITE SPACES -->

    <!-- Web browser displays the multiple white spaces / tab spaces in HTML  a single, 
    it ignores all the multiple spaces and show them as single space.
    Similarly with line breaks in paragrpah it won't show any until and unless you use <br> -->

    <!-- TRY OUT THE SAMPLE CODE  -->
    <p>This paragraph contains multiple spaces in the source code.</p>
    <p>
        This paragraph
        contains multiple tabs and line breaks
        in the source code.
    </p>

    <!-- Insert &nbsp; for creating extra consecutive spaces, 
        while insert <br> tag for creating line breaks on your web pages, 
        as demonstrated in the following example: -->

    <p>This paragraph has multiple&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;spaces.</p>
    <p>This paragraph has multiple<br><br>line<br><br><br>breaks.</p>


    <!--DEFINING PRE-FORMATTED TEXT -->

    <!-- Sometimes using &nbsp; and <br> is not very convienent instead we can use <pre> tag.
        In order to display a piece of text as it is, we use pre tag.
     -->
     <pre>

        This        is written
 
        Using  pre
 
        Tag
 
     </pre>

     <!--  Above text will get rendered as it is -->

     <!-- DIV & SPAN CONTAINERS -->

     <!-- 
        The Div tag

        div tag is often used as a container for other elements.
        div is a block-level element. [Always takes full width]

 
        The span tag

        span is an inline container. [Takes as much width as necessary]
      -->

      <div>This is some text.</div>
      <span>This is some another text.</span>
